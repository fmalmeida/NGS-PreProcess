Installation

Dependencies
============

This pipeline requires only `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_ (and its Docker images) and
`Nextflow <https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/index.html>`_ to run.

1. Installing Docker

   * Read more in their `manual <https://docs.docker.com/>`_
   * Or give this `in-house script <https://github.com/fmalmeida/bioinfo/blob/master/dockerfiles/docker_install.sh>`_ a try.

2. Installing Nextflow

   ``curl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash``

3. Download the pipeline

   ``./nextflow pull fmalmeida/ngs-preprocess``

4. Test your installation

   ``./nextflow run fmalmeida/ngs-preprocess --help``

5. Download required Docker images

   ``docker pull fmalmeida/ngs-preprocess``

6. (Optional) Install nf-core

   ``pip install nf-core>=1.10``

.. note::

  Now, everything is set up and ready to run. Remember to always keep your Docker images up to date (Docker pull will always download the latest).
