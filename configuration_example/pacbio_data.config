                    This file conatains all the parameters that are required by the pipeline.
                    Some of them can be left in blank and other ones need a proper configuration.
                    Every file containing a parameter will contain comments to guide its configuration.

                    Customizable parameters

                    All parameters are set under the params {} function.

                    Please do not change anything before the = sign.

                    Fields must be configured and set with values after the = sign.

                    Since the input file parameters will always work as a pattern match
                    it is required that it MUST ALWAYS be double quoted as the example below.

                    The pipeline will process each file that matches the pattern separately.

                                E.g. param1 = "my_reads/input*.fastq"
