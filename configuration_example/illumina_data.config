                    This file conatains all the parameters that are required by the pipeline.
                    Some of them can be left in blank and other ones need a proper configuration.
                    Every file containing a parameter will contain comments to guide its configuration.

                    Customizable parameters

                    All parameters are set under the params {} function.

                    Please do not change anything before the = sign.

                    Fields must be configured and set with values after the = sign.
